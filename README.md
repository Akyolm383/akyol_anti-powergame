Hello guys, this script simply remove grip when a player go off-road with a vehicle can prevent powergame for the high velocity when off-road, for this i decided to call it like that

the script checks the wheels of the vehicle, so if a t20 with wheel to default goes on dirt it will lose grip, on the other hand if a t20 have offroad wheels the grip dont change
